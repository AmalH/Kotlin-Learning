		<h2 id="javascript-dce">JavaScript DCE<a class="anchor" href="#javascript-dce"></a></h2>
		<p>Since version 1.1.4, Kotlin/JS includes a dead code elimination (DCE) tool.
			This tool allows to strip out unused properties, functions and classes from the generated JS.
			There are several ways you get unused declarations:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Functions can be inlined and never get called directly (which happens always except for few situations).</li>
			<li>You are using a shared library which provides much more functions than you actually need.
				For example, standard library (<code>kotlin.js</code>) contains functions for manipulating lists, arrays, char sequences,
				adapters for DOM, etc, which together gives about 1.3 mb file. A simple "Hello, world" application only requires
				console routines, which is only few kilobytes for the entire file.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Dead code elimination is often also called 'tree shaking'.</p>
		<h2 id="how-to-use">How to use<a class="anchor" href="#how-to-use"></a></h2>
		<p>DCE tool is currently available from Gradle.</p>
		<p>To activate DCE tool, add the following line to <code>build.gradle</code>:</p>
		<pre><code class="code _highlighted cm-s-default" data-lang="text/x-groovy"><span class="cm-variable">apply</span> <span class="cm-property">plugin:</span> <span class="cm-string">'kotlin-dce-js'</span>
</code></pre>
		<p>Note that if you are using multi-project build, you should apply plugin to the main project that is an entry point to your application.</p>
		<p>By default, the resulting set of JavaScript files (your application together with all dependencies)
			can be found at path <code>$BUILD_DIR/min/</code>, where <code>$BUILD_DIR</code> is the path to generated JavaScript
			(usually, <code>build/classes/main</code>).</p>
		<h2 id="configuring">Configuring<a class="anchor" href="#configuring"></a></h2>
		<p>To configure DCE on the main source set, you can use the <code>runDceKotlinJs</code> task
			(and corresponding <code>runDce&lt;sourceSetName&gt;KotlinJs</code> for other source sets).</p>
		<p>Sometimes you are going to use a Kotlin declaration directly from JavaScript, and it's being stripped out by DCE.
			You may want to keep this declaration. To do so, you can use the following syntax in <code>build.gradle</code>:</p>
		<pre><code class="code _highlighted cm-s-default" data-lang="text/x-groovy"><span class="cm-variable">runDceKotlinJs</span>.<span class="cm-property">keep</span> <span class="cm-string">"declarationToKeep"</span>[, <span class="cm-string">"declarationToKeep"</span>, ...]
</code></pre>
		<p>Where <code>declarationToKeep</code> has the following syntax:</p>
		<pre><code>moduleName.dot.separated.package.name.declarationName
</code></pre>
		<p>For example, consider a module is named <code>kotlin-js-example</code> and it contains a function named <code>toKeep</code>
			in package <code>org.jetbrains.kotlin.examples</code>. Use the following line:</p>
		<pre><code class="code _highlighted cm-s-default" data-lang="text/x-groovy"><span class="cm-variable">runDceKotlinJs</span>.<span class="cm-property">keep</span> <span class="cm-string">"kotlin-js-example_main.org.jetbrains.kotlin.examples.toKeep"</span>
</code></pre>
		<p>Note that if your function has parameters, its name will be mangled, so the mangled name should be used in the keep directive.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>As for 1.1.x versions, DCE tool is an <em>experimental</em> feature.
				This does not mean we are going to remove it, or that it's unusable for production.
				This means that we can change names of configuration parameters, default settings, etc.</li>
			<li>Currently you should not use DCE tool if your project is a shared library.
				It's only applicable when you are developing an application (which may use shared libraries).
				The reason is: DCE does not know which parts of the library are going to be used by the user's application.</li>
			<li>DCE does not perform minification (uglification) of your code by removing unnecessary whitespaces and shortening identifiers.
				You should use existing tools, like UglifyJS (https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2)
				or Google Closure Compiler (https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) for this purpose.</li>
