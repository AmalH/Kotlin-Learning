		<p>Kotlin is a great fit for developing server-side applications, allowing to write concise and expressive code while
			maintaining full compatibility with existing Java-based technology stacks and a smooth learning curve:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Expressiveness</strong>: Kotlin's innovative language features, such as its support for <a href="http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/type-safe-builders.html">type-safe builders</a>
				and <a href="/docs/reference/delegated-properties.html">delegated properties</a>, help build powerful and easy-to-use abstractions.</li>
			<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Kotlin's support for <a href="http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines.html">coroutines</a> helps build server-side applications
				that scale to massive numbers of clients with modest hardware requirements.</li>
			<li><strong>Interoperability</strong>: Kotlin is fully compatible with all Java-based frameworks, which lets you stay on your
				familiar technology stack while reaping the benefits of a more modern language.</li>
			<li><strong>Migration</strong>: Kotlin supports gradual, step by step migration of large codebases from Java to Kotlin. You can start
				writing new code in Kotlin while keeping older parts of your system in Java.</li>
			<li><strong>Tooling</strong>: In addition to great IDE support in general, Kotlin offers framework-specific tooling (for example,
				for Spring) in the plugin for IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.</li>
			<li><strong>Learning Curve</strong>: For a Java developer, getting started with Kotlin is very easy. The automated Java to Kotlin converter included in the Kotlin plugin helps with the first steps. <a href="http://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html">Kotlin Koans</a> offer a guide through the key features of the language with a series of interactive exercises.</li>

			<li>
				<p><a href="https://spring.io">Spring</a> makes use of Kotlin's language features to offer <a href="https://spring.io/blog/2017/01/04/introducing-kotlin-support-in-spring-framework-5-0">more concise APIs</a>,
					starting with version 5.0. The <a href="https://start.spring.io/#!language=kotlin">online project generator</a> allows to quickly generate a new project in Kotlin.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><a href="http://vertx.io">Vert.x</a>, a framework for building reactive Web applications on the JVM, offers <a href="https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-lang-kotlin">dedicated support</a>
					for Kotlin, including <a href="http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/kotlin/">full documentation</a>.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/kotlin/ktor">Ktor</a> is a Kotlin-native Web framework built by JetBrains, making use of coroutines
					for high scalability and offering an easy-to-use and idiomatic API.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/kotlin/kotlinx.html">kotlinx.html</a> is a DSL that can be used to build HTML in a Web application.
					It serves as an alternative to traditional templating systems such as JSP and FreeMarker.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The available options for persistence include direct JDBC access, JPA, as well as using NoSQL databases through their Java drivers.
					For JPA, the <a href="http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/compiler-plugins.html#jpa-support">kotlin-jpa compiler plugin</a> adapts
					Kotlin-compiled classes to the requirements of the framework.</p>
